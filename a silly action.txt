stay with her forever
hop with my hands tied
sing with my eyes closed
swear off booze
change my sex
pick my nose
pick her nose
punch my family
become a dwarf
find santa
find krampus
find the easter bunny

lift your feet as high as you can
play air guitar
play air violin
waddle like a penguin

marry a dog
marry a tiger
marry a cat
marry a rabbit
marry an animal

marry a mouse
marry a firefly

dance the chacha
dance the chicken dance
rub your tummy
crawl like a baby
cry like a baby
eat like a baby
walk on my knees
stand on one foot
hide my head in my shirt
smell my feet
smell her feet
hug myself
take off one piece of clothing
kiss my tummy
kiss my feet
kiss her feet
kiss her knee
tickle my feet
tickle my feet
wiggle my nose
burp the alphabet
hand a spoon off my nose
cross my eyes
lick my elbow
wiggle my ears
say a tounge twister
look at the world upside down
make balloon animals
moonwalk
do yo-yo tricks
wear my clothes inside out
kiss the ground
lick her face
lick an insect
